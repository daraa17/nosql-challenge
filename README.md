# nosql-challenge

The correct notebook for the Setup Starter is NoSQL_setup_starterDA

For this project, I referenced the official documentation from the PyMongo library at https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html and the MongoDB documentation at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/. I also used the AI Learning Assistant to help me troubleshoot any errors. For the 'Update the new restaurant with the BusinessTypeID you found' and 'The magazine is not interested in any establishments in Dover' parts of the project, I want to clarify that I accidentally re-ran the code, which resulted in the count showing as zero. However, I had initially executed the code correctly, and the intended updates and deletions were successfully performed.
